# DES 228 Project 2: Words in Motion
by Marisa Kahn
## project overview
This project conveys the concept of community through the dynamic and interactive experience with written word. 

To me, community is a group with which an individual shares similarities, interests, or an emotional bond. A song that encapsulates these feelings of community to be is 'Kiss From a Rose' by Seal. <br>

I chose this song primarily because of my connection to the community that introduced me to it. I was first introduced to it when I practiced artistic roller skating, where we would practice the California Swing, one of my favorite compulsory dances, to this song, a 138 waltz. Every time me or my club-mates hear this song, we automatically think of this song and how much joy skating to it brings us. <br>

In addition, I find community in my interpretation of the meaning of the song itself. The line in the chorus “I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray” compares a kiss with a lover to the blooming of a rose in cold weather (gray as in gray skies, rather than sunny), which is rare. To me, this metaphor is like the idea of those very few insanely close friendships I have; those trusting and close relationships are hard to come by, but they are very much appreciated and cherished.
