        <p>There used to be a graying tower alone on the sea<br>
            You became the light on the dark side of me<br>
            Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill<br>
            But did you know that when it snows<br>
            My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?<br>
            Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray<br>
            Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah<br>
            And now that your rose is in bloom<br>
            A light hits the gloom on the gray
        </p>
